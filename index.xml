With a codebase of around 20 thousand lines, the object oriented software package is optimized with over 10$\times$ improvements on time complexity comparing to the existing software while computing at the same level of precision.
Although our work emphasizes on the computation of phonons and phonon interactions as well as the prediction of materials thermodynamic and transport properties, the modular design of the package allows its individual parts to be used in a variety materials studies, including the electronic properties of materials, symmetry analysis of other materials properties, etc.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://lyuwenfu.me/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 18:26:44 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://lyuwenfu.me/about/</guid><description>About me I just earned my Ph.D. degree working with my advisor Prof. Chris Marianetti on Thermodynamics of Interacting Phonons at Columbia University. We are currently developing a highly optimized software that executes the methodologies described in the paper we published. It will be released soon. Stay tuned.
